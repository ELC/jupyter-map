# Jupyter Educational Map

## [Map Online: https://elc.github.io/jupyter-map/](https://elc.github.io/jupyter-map/)

This is an implementation of a map, originated from the https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/jupyter-education/HprQgDcDbo4

## Contribute

In case you want to add your institution to the map you have three options:

1. Via Google Forms - Recommended
    - Fill this [google form](https://kutt.it/jupyter-map)
2. Via Git
    - Go to this [link](https://kutt.it/jupyter-map-geojson) and download it
    - Go to [GeoJSON.io](http://geojson.io/)
    - Open the file you have just downloaded through the `Open` option (you can also copy&paste from the first link)
    - Add a new point and fill all the properties (Institution Name, Course Name, Course Area, Contact Name, Contact Email)
    - Download the file as GeoJSON
    - Submit a Pull Request with the new GeoJSON File
3. Via Email
    - You have to fill this template and send it to castanoezequielleonardo@gmail.com - Subject: "Jupyter Education Map - Request":
    ```json
        Institution name: MISSING
        Institution website: MISSING
        Course Name: MISSING
        Course Area:  MISSING
        Course URL (optional) : MISSING
        Instructor Name: MISSING
        Instructor Email: MISSING - Institutional email preferred
        Contact Name: MISSING
        Contact Email: MISSING - Institutional email preferred
    ```
    `NOTE: If you have more than one course you could send one email but each course should have a separated template.`

After that, you will receive a confirmation email with all the details. This process is yet manually so don't expect an inmediate response.

If you choose Google Forms all the steps will be more or less automated, in case of git, the format should be consistent or otherwise the PR would be rejected.

Thanks for all your support

In case of any idea about how to improve the system, send me an email to skielcast@gmail.com.
